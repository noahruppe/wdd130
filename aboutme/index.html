    <p>I live in North Carolina, I have a beautiful wife she is from the philippines. I met her while I was on my mission, I sereved in the Philippines Naga mission I spoke tagalog. And that is still the language I speak to my wife in.

    <p>Cool story actually about how I met my wife, I just got out of the MTC and I was heading to my mission and there was two missionaries who had just finished thier missions. and one out of the two missionaries was my wife and I told all my batch mates to look at that sister missionary and I told them all one day that sister is going to be my wife and it happened.</p>
    <p>Me and my wife our waiting for our first child he should be here in August and me and my whole family can't wait. This child for my mom and dad will be their 13th grandchild, I am the youngest out of 4 and that's all there really is to say about me. Again I'm excited to get to know all of you</p>
